# Basemap styles

Use gorgeous 2D and 3D basemap styles created by Mapzen's expert cartographers for Tangram.

As Mapzen's basemap styles are still in active development, you should peg an import to a specific **MAJOR** version, such as `9`, so you enjoy any minor and patch updates but are ensured of stable named scene elements.

You should only peg to the **LATEST** version if you are not modifying documented API scene elements.

Because each style imports additional resources, we provide a scene bundle in `.zip` format which includes the scene yaml, image, font, and any other required imports.

### All of Mapzen basemap styles support:

* Set Mapzen API key
* Alter label language and label density
* Customize basemap styling
* Mapzen icon library
* Data visualization overlays
* Transit overlay
* Default draw and user experience styles

### Some Mapzen basemap styles support:

* Bike overlay _(Walkabout)_
* Path overlay _(Walkabout)_
* Color themes _(Refill)_
